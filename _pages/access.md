## Accessing the FiQCI infrastructure

Access to the quantum computing resources goes through the LUMI supercomputer environment.

The first quantum calculations on the Helmi quantum computer through LUMI have been run, and the pilot phase for general access will open very soon!


### Access to LUMI

See the LUMI [webpage](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/get-started-2021/users-in-finland/) for details on how to get access to the LUMI environment.
