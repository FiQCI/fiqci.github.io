## Accessing the FiQCI infrastructure

The main access portal to the real quantum computing resources is through the LUMI supercomputer environment. Kvasi, the Quantum Learning Machine can be accessed directly.

### Access to Helmi

The pilot phase for Helmi access is now running! [More details here](_posts/2022-11-01-Helmi-pilot/), with instructions on how to apply for a pilot project.

### Access to Kvasi

See the [Kvasi documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/quantum-computing/overview/#kvasi) for details on how to connect to Kvasi.

### Access to LUMI

See the [LUMI webpage](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/get-started-2021/users-in-finland/) for details on how to get access to the LUMI environment.
