        The VTT Q5 "Helmi" is the first Finnish quantum computer. Helmi is based on superconducting technology and provides 5 qubits
        in a star-shape topology. Hybrid HPC+QC access was opened in 2022. Helmi is operated by VTT,
        and was co-developed with IQM Quantum Computers.

"/about/":
  desc: |-
    The Finnish Quantum-Computing Infrastructure (FiQCI) was established in 2020, when it became
    part of the Finnish Research Infrastructure (FIRI) roadmap of significant national research
    infrastructures within the Finnish research infrastructure ecosystem, maintained by the
    Research Council of Finland.

  mission: |-
    The mission of FiQCI is to provide state-of-the-art quantum-computing services such as
    computing time and training to the Finnish RDI communities. This includes providing a
    hybrid high-performance computing and quantum computing (HPC+QC) platform for developing,
    testing, and exploiting quantum-accelerated computational workflows. Through FiQCI, Finnish
    researchers have access to one of the most powerful hybrid HPC+nQC resources in the world,
    available for quantum accelerated research and development. The infrastructure also aims to
    offer possibilities to carry out experiments in quantum physics.

  maintain: |-
    FiQCI is jointly maintained, operated, and developed by VTT, Aalto University, and
    CSC - IT Center for Science.

  advisory-group:
