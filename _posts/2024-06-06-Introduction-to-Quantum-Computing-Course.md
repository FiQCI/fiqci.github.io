*Very good, interesting, and well taught course!*

*I like the CSC courses as they are practical and hands-on in nature.*

*The course was well organized. The lectures were explained clearly, and I learned much more than I expected.*

We are thrilled to share the highlights from our recent two-day course on quantum computing and the Finnish Quantum-Computing Infrastructure (FiQCI). The event, hosted on June 3rd and 4th, 2024, was a great success, bringing together people from different fields to learn about the fundamentals of quantum computing and FiQCI.

## A Big Thank You
First, a big thank you to all the participants for your feedback, interesting questions, and patience with the unexpected technical issues.

## Engaging with Quantum Computing
Day one of the course started with an introduction by Mikael Johansson (CSC) to the basic operating principles of quantum computers, emphasising the unique properties of qubits and the differences from classical computing. The basics of quantum programming, circuits, and gates were discussed. Following this, with the lead of Olli Mukkula (CSC), the participants got an overview of the Qiskit framework for quantum programming. The active participation and questions from the audience greatly enriched the learning experience.

On the second day, Suman Kundu (Aalto University) explained in detail how superconducting qubits actually work. Olli continued with explanations of basic quantum algorithms such as the Deutsch algorithm and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Hands-on exercises with Jupyter Notebooks and Qiskit gave the participants the exciting opportunity to execute jobs on the Helmi quantum computer, which is a part of the FiQCI infrastructure. During these practical sessions, the participants could apply the theoretical knowledge gained on the first day and witness first-hand the capabilities and peculiarities of quantum computing.

## The Role of FiQCI
The FiQCI plays a pivotal role in advancing quantum computing in Finland. By providing state-of-the-art quantum-computing services through the LUMI supercomputer, FiQCI supports the Finnish RDI (research, development, and innovation) communities in developing, testing, and exploiting quantum-accelerated computational workflows. FiQCI's hybrid HPC+QC platform is a product of the collaborative efforts of VTT, Aalto University, and CSC.

## Looking Forward
We are grateful to the audience for their active participation and for bringing their curiosity and enthusiasm to the course. We hope that everyone left with a better understanding of quantum computing, and we are excited to see how you will apply these skills in your future work!

Thank you once again to everyone who contributed to the success of this course. We are already preparing for more such events as continue our journey in the exciting field of quantum computing. Stay tuned for more updates and opportunities to engage directly with FiQCI.
